					Daonuts provides a suite of tools for enhancing online communities.
					The community decides what constitutes <i>contribution</i>. This may be positions or roles that members have, scoring based on upvote karma, or another metric altogether.
					This contribution score is tokenized on the Ethereum blockchain as two tokens. One <i>non-transferable</i> token represents the contribution score itself. Another <i>transferable</i> token is used as a community currency.
					These tokens are used for weighting within governance polls but also represent the stake of members based on their contributions to the community.
					The currency tokens are <i>spendable</i> within the community on:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>subscriptions to enhanced features</li>
					<li>rewarding other members for content</li>
					<li>buying temporary control of certain community assets</li>
					<li>gamified content curation</li>
				</ul>
				<!-- <h2>The Problem</h2> -->
				<!-- <p>Online communities lack agency. Members are beholden to decisions made by host platforms and administrators.</p> -->
